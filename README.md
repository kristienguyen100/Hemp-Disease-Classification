# Hemp Leaf Disease Classification

Hemp is a staple crop that is used in many different products in food, beverages, cosmetics, and paper. While growing hemp is a laborious task, it is more essential for hemp growers to prevent and detect hemp diseases. This project presents a hemp disease detection system using different machine learning models. All train and test pictures were manually collected by the group working on this project. The diseases are grey powdery mildew, grey mold, and mosaic virus. Pictures of healthy hemp were used as negative images. After necessary data cleaning and data pre-processing, the dataset was trained on four different machine learning models such as CNN, Deep CNN, Multinomial Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. I personally worked on te logistic regression model, so only the Jupyter IPYNB file for the logistic regression model is shown.
